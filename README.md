# Games

## Blackjack

Attempt to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21 (bust). If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack." If the player has a natural and the dealer does not, the player wins; if the dealer also has a natural, the game is a draw.

The player can hit or not, then when satisified or busted, the dealer's hand is revealed. A bust means losing, otherwise the hands are compared and the one closer to 21 wins.

Though this is a simplified version, more official rules can be found on [Bicycle Cards learn-to-play site](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack).
